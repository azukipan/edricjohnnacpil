I'm a researcher at [Corpy & Co., Inc.](https://corpy.co/) working on projects related to artificial intelligence. Lately, I've been focusing on machine learning for computer vision. I also conduct independent research on autonomous driving interfaces. You can learn more about me by browsing this page.
