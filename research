I am currently investigating the feasibility of surface electromyography (sEMG) controlled steering assistance for automobiles. In particular, my colleagues and I have conducted driving simulations and field experiments demonstrating the path following accuracy of sEMG interfaces during low-speed steering. Future research would assess the effect of sEMG interfaces on human factors. In general, my research interests include: 

(1) Biomechanics and human factors of driving 
(2) Artificial intelligence for robotics and automobiles 
(3) Human-machine interfaces.
