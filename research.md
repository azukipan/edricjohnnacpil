In addition to my research on applicatioins of artificial intelligence to optimization of optoelectronics, I am researching artifical intelligence in relation to topics such as autonomous driving and biosignal processing. For example, I am investigating the feasibility of [surface electromyography-controlled interfaces for automobiles](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edric-John-Nacpil). My colleagues and I have conducted driving simulations and field experiments demonstrating the path following accuracy of sEMG interfaces during low-speed steering. Future research would assess the effect of sEMG interfaces on human factors. 

I have prior professional experience in explanatory artificial intelligence at Corpy & Co., Inc. Much of what I have done in previous projects was related to object detection for computer vision systems in automotive applications. Some clients for these projects included Toyota Motor Corporation, AISAN Industry Co.,Ltd., and the National Institute of Advanced Science and Technology in Japan.

In general, my research interests include: 

(1) Artificial intelligence for robotics and automobiles  

(2) Biomechanics and human factors of driving

(3) Human-machine interfaces
